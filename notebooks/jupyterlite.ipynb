    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLite is an interactive environment created by utilising **JupyterLab components** and **extensions**. It operates fully within the browser as a **JupyterLab distribution**. In layman's term, JupyterLite is a **browser version** of JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although at the time of writing JupyterLite is **not officially released** as a project, most features of Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab are already included.\n",

    "### Subprojects\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: An **interactive web-based notebook** to create and share computational documents. A simple guide to run Jupyter Notebooks by using a notebook server can be found [here](https://github.com/gabhang/graph_theory), in the README file from my last research that uses Jupyter Notebooks as well. \n",
    "- **JupyterHub**: An enhanced version of Jupyter Notebook **for groups of users** to collaborate that runs in the cloud or on users' own hardware.\n",
    "- **JupyterLab**: A web-based interactive environment of Jupyter. Apart from Jupyter Notebooks, text editors, terminals and custom components work in JupyterLab too.\n",
    "- **Binder**: A project that generates a link to specify custom environments in an executable environment for *immediate reproducibility For example, Binder enables users to share links (which contains Jupyter Notebooks, Voilà, etc.) to interactive data analytics environments with other group of people.\n",
    "- **Voilà**: An application that converts Jupyter Notebook into a **dashboard** that is interactive and sharable\n",
    "- **Widgets**: Interative widgets that make information **\"alive\"** through various visualisation tools.\n",
