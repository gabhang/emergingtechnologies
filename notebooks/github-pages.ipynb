    "***\n",
    "To start up a webpage, it is necessary to have a ***client*** and a ***server***. A client is a device that has internet connection and a browser to be able to access a webpage. On the contrary, a server is a device that stores webpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients and servers communicate through an *application protocol* named **HTTP** to *send* and *receive* information. HTTP is a ***stateless protocol*** as it executes every transaction (consists of a request and a response) **independently**. As such, the state of the client will be discarded once the transaction has ended.\n",

    "\n",
    "For a client to be able to view a specific webpage, the client needs to obtain the webpage from the server that has it through an ***HTTP request***. Next, the server will prepare a duplicate of that webpage and send it back to the client which is called an ***HTTP response***. \n",

    "### HTTP Request and Response messages\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows a simple example of an HTTP request message and HTTP response message, which consists of ***start line (request line/response line)***, ***headers*** and ***body***.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/1565925092/files/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages96838.png\" width=600 height=600 />\n",

    "#### HTTP Request\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Request Line\n",
    "\n",
    "In HTTP Request message, the first line specifies `Method|Path|HTTP protocol version`. There are eight different methods available for sending a request:\n",
    "1. **GET**: Obtains data or content from the specific path.\n",
    "2. **HEAD**: Same function as GET but only the information or header of the content.\n",
    "3. **POST**: Sends data.\n",
    "4. **PUT**: Replaces data.\n",
    "5. **DELETE**: Deletes data.\n",
    "6. **CONNECT**: Connects network link.\n",
    "7. **OPTIONS**: Describes communication options.\n",
    "8. **TRACE**: Returns the request back for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is contained in the path of the request line to get response from that specific server. For the version of the HTTP protocol, although `HTTP/1.0` is usually used.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Request Header\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of headers can be 0 or more depending what and how many information does the client need. It is interesting to note that the header ends with a blank line.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Request Body\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the request message contains any data that is required for the server to produce a correct response that the client is demanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP response\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Response Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The response line specifies `HTTP protocol version|Status code|Status message|`. There are five groups of HTTP response status codes which are shown in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Status Code | Description |\n",
    "| :- | :- | \n",
    "| 100 - 199 | Informational responses |\n",
    "| 200 - 299 | Successful |\n",
    "| 300 - 399 | Redirection |\n",
    "| 400 - 499 | Client error |\n",
    "| 500 - 599 | Server error |\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of common status codes with their status messages:\n",
    "> **200**: OK\n",
    "\n",
    "> **400**: Bad Request\n",
    "\n",
    "> **404**: Not Found\n",
    "\n",
    "> **502**: Bad Getaway\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Response Header\n",
    "\n",
    "The response header contains information of the resource or content that the client has been requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Response Body\n",
    "\n",
    "After the response header's blank line, the response body contains any data that has been requested by the client or errors if the request is unsuccessful. \n",
