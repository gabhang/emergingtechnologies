    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation is an important operation that ***takes in some input conditions*** and ***generates an output*** that is determined by a ***specific set of rules***. According to dictionaries, *Cambridge Dictionary* defines computation as **\"the act or process of calculating an answer or amount by using a machine\"** while *Merriam-Webster* proposes **\"the act or action of computing\"** and **\"the use or operation of a computer\"**.\n",

    "## Theory of computation\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory of computation can be approached through three main branches, namely ***Automata Theory***, ***Computability Theory*** and ***Complexity Theory***. These fields use efficient algorithms to make use of computers' problem solving capabilities that will be explained in further details."
