# Emerging Technologies

This repository contains a research project for a final year software development module, Emerging Technologies, in Atlantic Technological University. This module introduces new and emerging technologies in computing for quick adaption. Jupyter notebooks are used to record the research outcome for this assessment within a JupyterLite instance. <br>

The JupyterLite instance created from this repository can be viewed [here](https://gabhang.github.io/emergingtechnologies/)

# Topics Discussed

Several topics are identified and broken down into several notebooks to study and analyse in depth in this research.

## GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a free static website generator by using GitHub Actions on GitHub. GitHub uses its own domain to publish webpages. An user account and an organisation account can only create one website per account while. Howwever, there is an unlimited creation of GitHub Pages for repositories.
## JupyterLite
Jupyterlite provides interactive environment to create notebooks, text editors, terminals and so on. It is a browser version of JupyterLab as the use the same components and extensions. It is still an unofficial Jupyter project and the time of writing.
## Computation
Computation is the use of a computer by using a specific of rules. Three main theories of computation are discussed. Big O Notation and Turing Machines are explained to support the theories.
## Fourier Transform
Fourier Transform is a useful mathematical technique to filter additional noise when processing images or sounds. Fundamental elements that are related to Fourier Transform are included too.
## Quantum Computing
Quantum Computing evolves from traditional computing with unbelivable computation power. Instead of bits, qubits are stored in quantum computing. Qiskit is used to better illustrate quantum computing.
