Jupyter default kernel is Python but additional kernals may be installed for other languages. Jupyter has various subprojects extending this fundamental idea."

    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: An **interactive web-based notebook** to create and share computational documents. A simple guide to run Jupyter Notebooks by using a notebook server can be found [here](https://github.com/gabhang/graph_theory), in the README file from my last research that uses Jupyter Notebooks as well. \n",
    "- **JupyterHub**: An enhanced version of Jupyter Notebook **for groups of users** to collaborate that runs in the cloud or on users' own hardware.\n",
    "- **JupyterLab**: A web-based interactive environment of Jupyter. Apart from Jupyter Notebooks, text editors, terminals and custom components work in JupyterLab too.\n",
    "- **Binder**: A project that generates a link to specify custom environments in an executable environment for *immediate reproducibility For example, Binder enables users to share links (which contains Jupyter Notebooks, Voilà, etc.) to interactive data analytics environments with other group of people.\n",
    "- **Voilà**: An application that converts Jupyter Notebook into a **dashboard** that is interactive and sharable\n",
    "- **Widgets**: Interative widgets that make information **\"alive\"** through various visualisation tools.\n",

The main difference between JupyterLite with JupyterLab and other Jupyter projects is that JupyterLite uses **WebAssembly (WASM)** instead of Jupyter server to fire up the environment. Hence, the data in JupyterLite is written to **local storage**. \n",
